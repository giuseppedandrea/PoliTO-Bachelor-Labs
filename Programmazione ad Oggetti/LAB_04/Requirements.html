<h1>Schools</h1>
<p>
Develop an application to allow managing the info about schools in a region.<br>
The application should allow the entry of information about municipalities, schools, branches, and communities.<br>
All the classes must be in the package "<b>schools</b>".
</p>

<h2>R1 - Municipalities and Communities</h2>
<p>
The interaction with the system takes place through class <b>Region</b> that manages communities and municipalities.
<br>
The definition of a community can be performed using the <b>newCommunity()</b>
method that accepts as arguments the name and a <b>Community.Type</b> value
indicating whether it is a hill or mountain community.
<br/>
The method returns a <b>Community</b> object.
</p>

<p>
The definition of a new municipality is done with the method <b>newMunicipality()</b>
accepting as arguments the name, the province and an optional reference to the 
<i>Community</i> of belonging.
<br>
The method returns a <b>Municipality</b> object.
</p>

<p>
Both classes offer the getter methods for the data they are initialized with.
<br>
The collection of all municipalities and communities
can be retrieve using the methods <b>getMunicipalities()</b>
and <b>getCommunities()</b> respectively.
<br>
In addition, given a <i>Municipality</i> the relative community
can be retrieved using the method <b>getCommunity()</b>, 
that returns an <i>Optional&lt;Community&gt;</i>,
which is empty if the municipality does not belong to
any community. Vice versa, given a <i>Community</i> the collection
of municipalities can be obtained with method <b>getMunicipalities()</b>. 
</p>

<h4>Hints</h4>
<ul class="hint">
<li>The declaration of an <i>enum</i> defines a new type that can be used as a primitive type:
    the only possible values are those listed inside the declaration, and can be referred to
    using the syntax <i>EnumName.VALUE</i>, where the name is the fully qualified name.
	
<li>To create an <i>Optional</i> object that contains a variable that may be <i>null</i> use the
<i>Optional.ofNullable()</i> that returns an <i>Optional</i> containing the provided value
or an empty <i>Optional</i> if the variable is <i>null</i>.
</ul>

<h2>R2 - Schools and branches</h2>
<p>
Schools are defined using the method <b>newSchool()</b>
that accepts as arguments, the name, the school code,
the school grade, and the description.  
<br/>
The method returns an object of class <b>School</b>, which provides
the required getter methods.
</p>
<p>
Schools are aggregations of branches (at least a branch for each school).


<p>
Schools can have one or more branches defines by means of
<b>newBranch()</b> method that accepts as arguments the unique branch code,
a reference to the <i>Municipality</i> where the
branch is located, the address, the CAP code
and a reference to the School the branch belongs to.
<br/>
The method returns a <b>Branch</b> object.
</p>

<p>
The class <i>Branch</i> provides the getter methods relative to the
parameter used to create it; in particular it offers the methods
<b>getMunicipality()</b>  and <b>getSchool()</b> to retrieve 
the municipality where it is located and the school it belongs to.
</p>

<p>
The class <i>School</i> provides the method <b>getBranches()</b>
to retrieve the collection of branches.
</p>

<h2>R3 - Reading from CSV</h2>
It is possible, using method <b>readData()</b>, to read the information
relative to the above classes from a URL, passed as argument.
<p>
The information relative to the schools of a region are defined within a file
with  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> encoding.
<br>
The CSV is structured with the following columns that contain information
about municipalities, communities, schools, and branches:

<style>
td {
  text-align:center;
}
th {
  text-align:left;
}
</style>
<table style="float:none;font-family:sans-serif;">
<tr><th># <th>Column		<th colspan="4">Information for classes <th>Translation
<tr><th><th>				<th><b>Municipality</b><th><b>Community</b><th><b>School</b><th><b>Branch</b>
<tr><td>0 <th><i>Provincia</i>		<td>X	        <td>	             	<td>	   			<td>		<th>Province
<tr><td>1 <th><i>Comune</i>			<td>X	  		<td>	             	<td>	   			<td>		<th>Municipality

<tr><td>10<th><i>Comunita Montana</i><td>	  		<td>X	            <td>	   			<td> 	<th>Mount Community
</table>
<p>
The file contains a row for each branch, therefore the information about schools, communities, and municipalities
are repeated more than once.
<p>
A school corresponds to a distinct school code (<i>"Cod scuola"</i>) that appears
for at least one branch.
The branches for a school are all those sharing the same school code.
<p>
The columns <i>Comunita Collinare</i> (hill community) and <i>Comunita Montana</i> (mount community) 
can contain the name of the community or be empty when the municipality does not belong to any community.
<p>
<!--
The column <i>Grado Scolastico</i> (school grade) contains both a number and a description (e.g. <i>"2 - Scuola primaria"</i>)
to create a <i>School</i> object, only the number before the <i>'-'</i> character is required.
-->
<p>
The data relative to the Piedmont regional schools is available in file <i>schools.csv</i> <sup>(<a href="#note"> * </a>)</sup>.
 
<p>
<h4>Hints:</h4>

<ul class="hint">
<li>While reading the file, for each row, it is required, before creating a new branch,
to crate first the community (if any and if not present), then the municipality
(if not present yet), and the school (if not present yet).

<li>For reading the lines from a file start from the code fragment
already present in method <i>readData()</i> that reads
the rows from a file and adds them to a list.
The first row of the files contains the headings, while the
successive ones contain the actual data.
</ul>


<h2>R4 - Queries</h2>
<p>
The method <b>countSchoolsPerDescription()</b> returns a map containing
as key the school description and as value the number of schools
corresponding to that description.
<p>
The method <b>countBranchesPerMunicipality()</b> returns a map containing
as key the name of the municipality and as value the number
of branches belonging to it.
<p>
The method <b>countBranchesPerMunicipalityPerProvince()</b> returns a map
have as key the  province and as value another map that links a municipality 
(of the province) to the relative number of school branches.
<p>
The method <b>countSchoolsPerMunicipality()</b> returns a list of strings, each with the format 
"<i>### - XXXXXX</i>" where
<i>###</i> represents the number of schools and <i>XXXXXX</i> represents the name of the municipality.
<p>
The method <b>countSchoolsPerCommunity()</b> returns a list of strings, each with the format 
"<i>### - XXXXXX</i>" where <i>###</i> represents the number of schools and <i>XXXXXX</i> represents the name of the community.
sorted in decreasing ordered by number of schools.
Only the schools having at least a branch in a municipality that belongs to a community.

<h4>Hints</h4>

<ul class="hint">
<li>When sorting elements in reverse order, based on an attribute,
it is better to use the form <i>comparing(Element::getValue,reverseOrder())</i>
than <i>comparing(Element::getValue).reversed()</i> because this latter
form makes it difficult for the compiler to infer the types.
