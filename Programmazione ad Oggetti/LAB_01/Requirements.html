<h1 style="text-align: center;">University Management System</h1>

Design and implement a program to manage university courses, teachers, and students.<br>
All the classes must belong to the package <b>university</b>.
<p>

<h2 id="R1">R1. University</h2>
<p>
The user interface (not part of this assignment) interacts through the class <b>University</b>, 
whose constructor accepts as argument the name of the university.
</p><p>
The name of the university can be retrieved through method <b>getName()</b>.<p>
It is possible to assign the name of the Rector by means of the method <b>setRector()</b> 
that accepts as arguments the first and last name of the Rector.
</p><p>
The method <b>getRector()</b> returns the first and last name of the Rector concatenated and 
separated by a blank space (<i>" "</i>). 
</p>


<h2 id="R2" >R2. Students</h2>
<p>
It is possible to enter information concerning a new student thought the method 
<b>enroll()</b> of class <i>University</i>, that accepts as arguments first and last name 
of the student; the method returns the ID number that has been assigned to the student.<br>
ID numbers are are assigned progressively in each university starting from number 10000.
</p><p>
We can assume that each university has at most 1000 enrolled students.
</p><p>
To retrieve the information about a student we can use the method <b>student()</b> 
that accepts as  an argument the ID number and returns a string made up of ID, first, 
and last name separated by blank spaces. 
</p>

<h2 id="R3">R3. Courses</h2>
<p>
To define a new course we can use the method <b>activate()</b> that accepts as arguments
the title of the course and the name of the responsible teacher. The method returns an integer
that corresponds to the course code. Course codes are assigned progressively starting from 10.
</p><p>
We can safely assume that no university has more than 50 courses.
</p><p>
To retrieve the information about a course we can used the method <b>course()</b> that accepts 
the course's code and returns a string containing code, title, and teacher separated by blank 
spaces.
</p>

<h2 id="R4">R4. Course attendance</h2>
<p>
Students that wish to attend a course must be registered through the method <b>register()</b> 
that accepts as arguments the ID of the student and the course's code.
</p><p>
We can safely assume that no course has more than 100 attendees and that each student 
can attend no more that 25 distinct courses.
</p><p>
To get the list of students attending a course we can use the method <b>listAttendees()</b> 
that accepts the code of the course and returns a string containing the list of attendees.<br>
The students appear one per row (rows are terminated by a new-line character <i>'\n'</i>) 
and each row is formatted as describe in requirement <a href="#R2">R2</a>.
</p><p>
Given the ID of a student, it is possible to get the  list of courses she is attending
through the method <b>studyPlan()</b>. The courses are described one per row and formatted 
as described in requirement <a href="#R3">R3</a>.
