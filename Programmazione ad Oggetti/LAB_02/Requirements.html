<h1>Hydraulic System Simulation</h1>

Design and implement a program to manage the simulation of an hydraulic system.<br>
All the classes must belong to the package <code>hydraulic</code>.
<p>

<h2>R1. Elements and pipes</h2>
A hydraulic system is composed of elements (of different types) 
connected to each other through pipes.
A system is represented by an object of class <b>HSystem</b> that 
provides the method <b>addElement()</b> that accepts 
as argument an object of class <b>Element</b> and adds it to an internal list.
<br>
By means of method <b>getElements()</b> it is possible to get an array of the 
elements that compose the system.
The length of the array corresponds to the number of elements added to the system.
<br>

<h2>R2. Simple elements</h2>

The simple elements are represented by the classes <b>Source</b>, <b>Tap</b>, 
and <b>Sink</b>.
<br>
All elements have a name that can be read through the getter method <b>getName()</b>.
<br>
It is possible to connect the output of an element to the input of another element by 
means of the method <b>connect()</b>
that accepts as argument the element whose input should be connected to the output of the subject:
<i>a.connect(b);</i> connects the output of element <i>a</i> to the input of element <i>b</i>.
<br>
The invocation of method connect on class Sink has no effect and simply prints an error message.
<br>
Given an element, it is possible to know to which other output element it is connected by means
 of the method <b>getOutput()</b> that returns an Element object.
<p>


<h2>R3. Complex elements</h2>
In addition to the simple elements described above, there are some complex elements.
The "<i>T</i>" element, represented by class <b>Split</b>, allows splitting the input flow into
two output flows. For this class, the <b>connect()</b> method accept an additional argument
specifying which determines the output that is being connected, such parameter may assume
the values <i>0</i> for the first output and <i>1</i> for the second output.
<br>
For this class, it is possible to know which elements are connected to the outputs, by means
of the method <b>getOutputs()</b> that returns an array. 
<p>

<h2>R4. Simulation</h2>

Given a <i>valid</i> system, i.e. a tree with a source as the root and where each path ends with a sink,
it is possible to compute flow and how it is split among the distinct paths.
<p>
The computation takes place into two phases: in the first phase the parameters of
the elements belonging to the system are defined, in the second phase the 
simulation starts. 
<p>
The exit flow of a Source can be defined through the method <b>setFlow()</b> that accepts a number 
representing the flow in cubic meters per hour.
<br>
Taps can be set open or closed using the method <b>setOpen()</b> that accepts a boolean argument.
When a tap is open the output flow is equal to the input flow, otherwise the output is zero.
<br>
For the T split the input flow is divided into two equal output flows (each a half of the input flow).
<p>
The <b>simulate()</b> method of class <i>HSystem</i>, performs the flow computations for each element in the system
starting from each source and prints, for each element, the name, the input, and the output flow.
(for the source, only the output flow, and for the sink just the input flow).
<p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Hint: given an object, to find out if it is an instance
of a specific class the operator <i>instanceof</i> can be used.<br/>
E.g. </span><b>if( element instanceof Source )</b>.


<h2>R5. Visualization (optional)</h2>

Method <b>layout()</b> of class <i>HSystem</i> returns a string containing
the layout of the system using ASCII characters and spacing.
<p>
For instance, a system composed of a <i>Source</i>, connected to a <i>Tab</i>, 
that is connected to a <i>Split</i> whose outputs are connected to <i>Sink</i>s,
would return a layout like the following one:
<pre>
[Src]Source -> [R]Tap -> [T]Split +-> [sink A]Sink |
                                  | 
                                  +-> [sink B]Sink | 
</pre>
